# A £140 laptop for work and play - revived ultrabook

### October 2018

## Introduction

In the past, I've explored [how cheap can a laptop be](chromebook.md) whilst still offering standard functionality, and found various suitable options around £60, but with a bottleneck in experience due to a low spec CPU and limited hard drive space. Here, I want to see if these limitations can be resolved by looking at the next price bracket up: £100 to £150. 

There are many types of laptop that can be found second hand in this price range. Of those laptops that are around the age of the cheaper laptops I found, there was only a marginal improvement in specifications. But I did notice this price bracket opened up an additional category compared the cheaper options: *old ultrabooks*.

## Old Hardware
Hardware does age, but some bits of hardware age more than others. Its important to note here that often age doesn't just refer to time since production, but is also relative to new advancements in that time period. Lets take an example - the ultrabooks I found were made around 2012 (give or take a few years). Since the production of many of these ultrabooks, solid state drives have now become the default, replacing hard disk drives. Compared to, say, keyboard technology, we'd say the hard drive hardware has aged quite a bit (whereas keyboards changes are less substantial). Generally, an old ultrabook can still have a decent shell, screen, RAM, CPU (see [here](bargain_cpus.md) for a comparison of older CPUs), keyboard, ports, trackpad; all in working order, and can be picked up for a bargain ;).

I'm particularly fond of buying from reputable second hand laptop retailers. Like Chromebooks, it seems eBay is also flooded with unwanted older ultrabooks. I picked up a DELL E7240 for £55 with the following specs:

* 12.5 inch screen
* Intel i5 4th gen - suitable for all everyday needs without being a bottleneck
* 4 GB of RAM - has an additional slot to upgrade
* Missing hard drive and battery
* Excellent ports

I actually see the missing hard drive and battery as a plus. A replacement battery guarantees good battery life (without having to pay for the old original), and a replacement hard drive allows me to choose just what I want (again, without have to pay for the old original...). In addition to the laptop itself, I bought the following to bring it back to life:

* New battery + power supply: £50
* 128 GB SSD: £32

This gives a total around £140 (c.f with £1000 when this model was released in 2013). 

## OS
Dell has excellent Linux compatibility, and before buying, I found plenty of E7240 Linux users. Xubuntu seems to run with no problems, and is nice and snappy, as I'd expect given these specs. 

## Experience & Conclusion
This laptop is very impressive indeed. The previous bottlenecks I experience with the cheaper category - a low spec CPU and limited hard drive space - are completely removed! Larger hard drives are available, and the CPU is more than capable for every-day tasks. Since we replaced the battery, and the CPU is optimised for low power, the battery life is excellent (although not quite as good as my Chromebook). Compared to my work ultrabook, which cost around 10x more, there's hardly a difference (day-to-day). This laptop has a bunch of more useful ports...

As can be expected, the laptop itself does have some signs of wear and tear from over the years, which are all cosmetic except for a slightly jumpy mouse pad. The sellers did actually notify me of this when I bought it, so it might be worth double checking with the seller if there are any known issues (there are so many old ultrabooks on the market that a decent one will come along in no time). There may also be some risk that other components may start breaking simply because of age. On the other hand, if you want a laptop with ultrabook specs but without a new ultrabook cost, this may be a good option.
