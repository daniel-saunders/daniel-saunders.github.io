# 30th Oct 2017 - Motivation & first thoughts on components

I've decided the time has come to build my first PC by myself. This will ultimatly replace my home machine, sometimes used as a proramming station, and for tinkering with software ideas and home hardwards projects. This machine is not aimed at gaming, and not really intense computing - I'm aiming for something that is more than capable for home browsing and programming, with the option of doing some fun stuff with a not-so-expensive GPU(s). 

After googling through many articles, I found www.logicalincrements.com to be an extremely useful starting point, giving many pre-planned build recommendations, giving a good indication of what to expect for your money.

For the PC itself (not including extremeties like screens etc), I've set a budget of £200 (w/o GPU, to begin with). As a beginner, who doesn't need intensive computing at home, this should be enough to get something decent running, and allow for some fun upgrades in the future to make it more competitive. 

## Components

Where possible, to save some cash, I'm happy to buy second hand. Some quick searches suggests that CEX is just as competitive as ebay, whilst giving a one year warrenty. The CEX website is also surprisingly complete when it comes to component listings. For this machines first iteration, this first set of components will include:

* CPU

* Motherboard
    * [ASROCK B250M](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01N0LMLMM/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&psc=1#Ask), about £71 on Amazon
    * Decieding features: healthy number of ram & PSI ports, less limited chipset compared to cheaper alternatives.
    * Looking on logical increments, this is actaully a bit more pricey than the other components listed here. This is because upgrading the motherboard at a later date is such a pain. I changed my mind a few times about this, and on two occasions went up two models on LI for extra option. I also don't care much for overclocking.
    * Am still thinking of this cheaper option...

* PSU

* RAM: 
    * DDR4 4GB, £20 from [CEX](https://uk.webuy.com/product.php?sku=SMEM4G2400#.WfejHhO0OwA)
    * I'm pretty good at monitoring my RAM usage. My work machine boasts 16GB, and I do feel sorry for 14G of those bytes, which simply don't do much the majority of the time. Sure, they help a bit, but knowing my two other laptops run wonderfully with 1/4 of that, I know that 4GB is perfectly sufficient for this first iteration. Since RAM cost is pretty linear with capacity, this will be one of the first things to upgrade.
