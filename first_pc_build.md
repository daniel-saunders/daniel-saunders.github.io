# 30th Oct 2017 - Motivation & first thoughts on components

I've decided the time has come to build my first PC by myself. This will ultimatly replace my home machine, sometimes used as a proramming station, and for tinkering with software ideas and home hardwards projects. This machine is not aimed at gaming, and not really intense computing - I'm aiming for something that is more than capable for home browsing and programming, with the option of doing some fun stuff with a not-so-expensive GPU(s). 

After googling through many articles, I found www.logicalincrements.com to be an extremely useful starting point, giving many pre-planned build recommendations, giving a good indication of what to expect for your money.

For the PC itself (not including extremeties like screens etc), I originally wanted to keep the cost low. But, I quickly realised going cheap can have serious impacts on future proofing and potential future upgrades. I'd like to keep below £400. 

## OS
Linux, obvs. Part of the fun using this machine will be trying out various distros, so light weight isn't guarenteed (but is likely). 

## Components

Where possible, to save some cash, I'm happy to buy second hand. Some quick searches suggests that CEX is just as competitive as ebay, whilst giving a one year warrenty. The CEX website is also surprisingly complete when it comes to component listings. For this machines first iteration, this first set of components will include:

* CPU
    * i3 6100 from [CEX](https://uk.webuy.com/product.php?sku=SCPUINTI36100TA#.Wfeq8xO0OwA), £65
    * I'm slightly more familiar with Intel than AMD, so this build will be Intel 1151. Replacing the CPU is a potential upgrade, but is a bit wasteful. Looking at online benchmarks, this is more than capable for what I want. 

* Motherboard
    * [ASROCK B250M](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01N0LMLMM/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&psc=1#Ask), about £71 on Amazon (but i got a bargain at £50). 
    * Deciding features: healthy number of ram & PSI ports, less limited chipset compared to cheaper alternatives.
    * Looking on logical increments, this is actaully a bit more pricey than the other components listed here. This is because upgrading the motherboard at a later date is such a pain. I changed my mind a few times about this, and on two occasions went up two models on LI for extra option. I also don't care much for overclocking.

* PSU

* Processor fan

* RAM
    * DDR4 8GB
    * I'm pretty good at monitoring my RAM usage. My work machine boasts 16GB, and I do feel sorry for 14G of those bytes, which simply don't do much the majority of the time. Sure, they help a bit, but knowing my two other laptops run wonderfully with 1/4 of that. That said, 4 GB is low given the rest of this build, so 8 GB tis. 
    
* Case
    * [CiT Dark Soul], £35 from amazon.
    * Cheap as chips, with a nice window on the side.
    
* Hard-drive
    * 256 GB Samsung m.2, £116 from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01MSE30WA/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_3?ie=UTF8&smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&th=1)
    * This thing should be a beast!
